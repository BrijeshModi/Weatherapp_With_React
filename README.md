# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `NPM start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `As per task requirements I have used below Tech Stack:`
VS Code
Node.Js
NPM
 ReactJs 
(State based Class Componet, Stateless Function Component, life-cycle hooks, Axios for data fetch, Spread operator, arrow functions ES6)
React-Router
Bootstrp
Github


### `How to Run App:`
1.	Clone the repository
2.	Open project in VS Code
3.	Run NPM Install command weatherapp level directory
4.	Once node module update
5.	Run the NPM Start command to run the app.
6.	App will open in browser.


### `How Weaterapp works:`
When the weather-app load in the browser, user gets the local weather of the city.
User gets City-Name, Country-Code, Current-Temp, Wind-Speed, Sunrise and Sunset.

Weather-app has Navbar which is fully responsive. From the Navbar user can route the page to forecast and about.

In the forecast page user will have selection choice of below city.
London, Mumbai, Tokyo, Newyork and Sydney.
User can select the city and page will render and component will update with 16 days forecast of mintemp and maxtemp. 
On the same page user can filter the day with minimum temp and maximum temp.
And component will update with filter result at bottom.
User can only put digit in the search area.

### `Making Weather app:`

I have used ReactJs to develop app because it was original requirement and react is giving Single Page Application facility, so `performance` of site is quick responsive and fast.

For clear code and future requirements of reusable component, I have used component methodology so in future if requirements go bigger, developer can handle very easily and understands where to change.
